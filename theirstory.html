		<p>Kyle and Melissa have been together for an astounding 5 years!
		It all started when Melissa got a phone call from a friend 
		asking her if she wanted to hang out with her and some friends. 
		Melissa was all for it. She was picked up the next day by her friend,
		boyfriend, and boyfriends friend (Kyle). Kyle was really shy at first 
		and kept to himself. They drove around for hours getting to know each
		other and catching up. Melissa's friend convinced her to give Kyle her 
		number, and so she did.</p>
		<p>After a few days of hanging out, they went to a karaoke night at the 
		VFW Post. Kyle had a crazy idea and asked Melissa's friend for one of her rings.
		Kyle got down on one knee with the ring and asked Melissa to be his 
		girlfriend. After being at the VFW post, everyone went back to Melissa's friends
		house and stayed the night there.</p>
		<p>Melissa and Kyle have been together ever since. They have lived together for 
		3 years now	in an appartments with their 3 adorable cats. These two have had their 
		ups and down, but always seem to work through the toughest of times. They are the
		strongest couple anyone has ever seen. </p>
